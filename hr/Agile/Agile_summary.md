# Introduction to Agile

[[_TOC_]]

## What is Agile?

> **Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development**

Agile helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

> **Waterfall The waterfall project management approach follows a linear, sequential flow.**

It works well for work that has predictable, recurring processes, yet it can leave development teams flat-footed and unable to adjust faster than a competitor. 

**Agile calls for collaborative cross-functional teams. Open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile**. Although the project lead or product owner typically prioritizes the work to be delivered, the team takes the lead on deciding how the work will get done, self-organizing around granular tasks and assignments.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, **agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.**

## The Agile Manifesto

> **Agile Manifesto**
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>  **Responding to change** over following a plan

The original [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) didn't prescribe two-week iterations or an ideal team size. It simply laid out a set of core values that put people first. The way you and your team live those values today

The Agile Manifesto is better understood via the twelve principles that are behind it.

> **Principles behind the Agile Manifesto**
>
> 1. Our **highest priority is to satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> 2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> 3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> 4. Business people and developers **must work together daily** throughout the project.
>
> 5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
>
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**. (Online meeting)
>
> 7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**.
>
> 8. Agile processes **promote sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace indefinitely**.
>
> 9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**.
>
> 10. **Simplicity** - **the art of maximizing the amount of work not done** is essential.
>
> 11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**.
>
> 12. At regular intervals, **the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly**.

## Why Agile?

Teams choose **agile** so they can **respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans.** "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

As described by the Agile Manifesto, authentic human interactions are more important than rigid processes. **Collaborating with customers and teammates is more important than predefined arrangements**. And **delivering a working solution to the customer's problem is more important than hyper-detailed documentation.**

An agile team unites under a shared vision, then brings it to life the way they know is best. **Each team sets their own standards for quality, usability, and completeness.** Their "definition of done" then informs how fast they'll churn the work out.

The way each team practices agile should be unique to their needs and culture.



## Flavors of Agile (Frameworks)

The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marks the birth of agile as a methodology. Since then, many agile frameworks have emerged such as **Scrum**, **Kanban**, **Lean**. Each embodies the core principles of frequent iteration, continuous learning, and high quality in its own way.

### Scrum

- How to make a dev-team productive and effective.
- How to do effective daily meetings.

> **Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset.** 

While scrum is structured, it is not entirely rigid. Its execution can be tailored to the needs of any organization. Clear communication, transparency, and a dedication to continuous improvement should always remain at the center of whatever framework you choose.

You should be just as agile with your framework as you are with your product. Take the necessary time to check in on how things are going, make adjustments if needed, and don’t force something just for the sake of consistency.

#### Artifacts

Artifacts are something that we make, like a tool to solve a problem. In scrum, these three artifacts are a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and an increment with your definition of “done”. They are the three constants in a scrum team that we continue to revisit and invest in overtime.

- **<u>Product Backlog</u> is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or product manager**. This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. **It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do” list.** The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.
- **<u>Sprint Backlog</u> is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle**. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. A **sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. <u>However</u>, the fundamental sprint goal – what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint – cannot be compromised.**
- **<u>Increment</u> (or Sprint Goal) is the usable end-product from a sprint.** The team shows a demo of what was completed in the sprint. It depends on how your teams defines “Done” and how you define your sprint goals. For example, some teams choose to release something to their customers at the end of every sprint. So their definition of ‘done’ would be ‘shipped’. However, this may not be realistic of other types of teams. Say you work on a server-based product that can only ship to your customers every quarter. You may still choose to work in 2-week sprints, but your definition of ‘done’ may be finishing part of a larger version that you plan to ship together. But of course, the longer it takes to release software, the higher the risk that software will miss the mark.

#### Scrum Events

1. **Organize the backlog**: This event is the responsibility of the product owner. The product owner’s main jobs are to drive the product towards its product vision and have a constant pulse on the market and the customer. Therefore, he/she maintains this list using feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be worked on at any given time.
2. **Sprint planning**: The work to be performed (scope) during the current [sprint](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/glossary/sprint) is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal. Specific use stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog. These stories always align with the goal and are also agreed upon by the scrum team to be feasible to implement during the sprint.
   
    At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.
3. **Sprint**: A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. Two weeks is a pretty typical length for a sprint, though some teams find a week to be easier to scope or a month to be easier to deliver a valuable increment. Dave West, from Scrum.org advises that the more complex the work and the more unknowns, the shorter the sprint should be. But it’s really up to your team, and you shouldn’t be afraid to change it if it’s not working! During this period, the scope can be re-negotiated between the product owner and the development team if necessary. This forms the crux of the empirical nature of scrum.
   
    All the events — from planning to retrospective — happen during the sprint. Once a certain time interval for a sprint is established, it has to remain consistent throughout the development period. This helps the team learn from past experiences and apply that insight to future sprints.
4. **Daily scrum or stand up**: This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually mornings) and place to keep it simple. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes, but that’s just a guideline. This meeting is also called a ‘daily stand-up’ emphasizing that it needs to be a quick one. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.
   
    <u>The stand up is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers.</u> 
    
    A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:
    
    • What did I do yesterday?
    • What do I plan to do today?
    • Are there any obstacles?
    
    However, we’ve seen the meeting quickly turn into people reading from their calendars from yesterday and for the next day. The theory behind the stand up is that it keep distracting chatter to a daily meeting, so the team can focus on the work for the rest of the day. So if it turns into a daily calendar read-out, don’t be afraid to change it up and get creative.
5. **Sprint review**: At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now ‘Done’ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment, although in most cases the increment is released.
   
    This review meeting is also when the product owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.
6. **Sprint retrospective**: The [retrospective](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/retrospectives) is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.

#### Roles within Scrum

A scrum team needs three specific roles: <u>product owner, scrum master, and the development team</u>. And because scrum teams are cross-functional, the development team includes testers, designers, UX specialists, and ops engineers in addition to developers. 

##### Product owner 

<u>Product owners are the managers of the project.</u> They are focused on understanding business, customer, and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. Effective product owners:

- Build and manage the product backlog.
- Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog.
- Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.
- Decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery.

The product owner is not always the product manager. Product owners focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business. <u>Also, it's important that the product owner be an individual. No development team wants mixed guidance from multiple product owners.</u>

##### Scrum master 

<u>Scrum masters are the leader within their teams</u>. They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.

<u>An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done</u> by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, he/she schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.

##### Development team 

**Scrum teams get s*%& done**. They are are the responsible for sustainable development practices. The most effective scrum teams are tight-knit, co-located, and <u>usually five to seven members</u>. One way to work out the team size is to use the famous ‘two pizza rule’ coined by Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon (the team should be small enough to share two pizzas).

**Team members have differing skill sets**, and cross-train each other so no one person becomes a bottleneck in the delivery of work. Strong scrum teams <u>are self-organising and approach their projects with a clear ‘we’ attitude.</u> All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.

The scrum team drives the plan for each sprint. <u>They forecast how much work they believe they can complete over the iteration using their historical velocity as a guide.</u> Keeping the iteration length fixed gives the development team important feedback on their estimation and delivery process, which in turn makes their forecasts increasingly accurate over time.

#### Burndown Chart

<u>A burndown chart shows the amount of work that has been completed in an epic or sprint</u>, and the total work remaining. Burndown charts are used to predict your team's likelihood of completing their work in the time available. They're also great for keeping the team aware of any scope creep that occurs.

![](/home/stormy/x4_PGHI_Tiger-Team/Technical/Agile/burndown-tutorial_02.png)

1. **Estimation statistic**: The vertical axis represents the estimation statistic that you've selected.
2. **Remaining values**: The red line represents the total amount of work left in the sprint, according to your team's estimates.
3. **Guideline**: The grey line shows an approximation of where your team should be, assuming linear progress. If the red line is below this line, congratulations - your team's on track to completing all their work by the end of the sprint. This isn't foolproof though; it's just another piece of information to use while monitoring team progress.

### Kanban

- How do organize and report your work to the group.
- How to identify the next task, set up priorities, and estimate speed.

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement Agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity  and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a <u>kanban board</u>, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

#### Kanban Board

A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help  visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or  flow). It can help both Agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards,  columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work.

Kanban Boards can be broken down into five components: <u>Visual signals</u>,  <u>columns</u>, <u>work-in-progress limits</u>, <u>a commitment point</u>, and a <u>delivery  point</u>.

![](/home/stormy/x4_PGHI_Tiger-Team/Technical/Agile/Elements_of_a_kanban_board.png)

1. **Visual Signals** — One of the first things you’ll notice about a kanban board are the  visual cards (stickies, tickets, or otherwise). Kanban teams write all  of their projects and work items onto cards, usually one per card. For  agile teams, each card could encapsulate one user story. Once on the board, these visual signals help teammates and stakeholders quickly understand what the team is working on.
2. **Columns** — Another hallmark of the kanban board are the columns. Each column  represents a specific activity that together compose a “workflow”. Cards flow through the workflow until completion. Workflows can be as simple as “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Complete,” or much more complex.
3. **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits** — WIP limits are the maximum number of cards that can be in one column  at any given time. A column with a WIP limit of three cannot have more  than three cards in it. When the column is “maxed-out” the team needs to swarm on those cards and move them forward before new cards can move  into that stage of the workflow. These WIP limits are critical for  exposing bottlenecks in the workflow and maximizing flow. WIP limits  give you an early warning sign that you committed to too much work.
4. **Commitment point** — Kanban teams often have a backlog for their board. This is where  customers and teammates put ideas for projects that the team can pick up when they are ready. The commitment point is the moment when an idea is picked up by the team and work starts on the project.
5. **Delivery point** — The delivery point is the end of a kanban team’s workflow. For most  teams, the delivery point is when the product or service is in the hands of the customer. The team’s goal is to take cards from the commitment  point to the delivery point as fast as possible. The elapsed time  between the two is the called Lead Time. Kanban teams are continuously  improving to decrease their lead time as much as possible.  

A kanban board with these five elements will undoubtedly set your team up for success. But now, I’ll present an opposing point of view.

Jim Benson says that kanban only has two rules: Limit work in progress and  visualize your work. If you start with just those rules and apply them  to your work, your kanban board will look much different than the one  described above. And thats ok! Jim advocates for starting with just  these two rules because, he says, “The more rules you add, the less  contexts it fits into.”

### Lean

It’s paying someone not do any real work, paying for supplies you don’t need, or paying for team members to sort out a preventable issue. Lean agile aims to eliminate wasteful resources and tasks for improved efficiency and reduced costs - while never sacrificing quality. In fact, lean agile prioritizes bringing value to the customer with every decision that’s made.

> **Lean agile is a development method that helps teams identify waste and refine processes.**

It’s a guiding mindset that facilitates efficiency, effectiveness, and continuous improvement. <u>The focus lies on organization and cleanness</u>. When you eliminate distractions and waste, it establishes an organized workspace and workflow. This helps you focus on what’s most important, ensuring you work efficiently and effectively.

Lean agile, or lean software development, originates from the principles of <u>lean manufacturing</u>. The concept was brought into manufacturing to improve profits by reducing costs instead of solely relying on increased sales. If a company can eliminate waste and become more efficient, it can save money, thereby increasing overall profits.

> <u>Lean manufacturing</u> is a production process based on an ideology of maximising productivity while simultaneously minimising waste within a manufacturing operation. The lean principle sees waste is anything that doesn’t add value that the customers are willing to pay for.

Lean agile is an agile methodology that, in basic terms, is quite simple: <u>improve efficiency by eliminating waste</u>. Unlike traditional, waterfall project management, which dictates a set plan laid out by a project manager, lean agile strives to reduce all tasks and activities that don’t provide real value. This helps ensure everyone involved in a project or product development can work at optimal efficiency.

- **Waste less time**

Time is wasted when processes don’t run smoothly. In lean manufacturing, it’s important for goods and services to be delivered quickly and effectively. No one's time should be wasted on the job, and companies should aim for shorter lead times without sacrificing quality.

Wasting time in any industry is expensive, but it’s particularly important to pay attention when working in agile software development. <u>Even a small bottleneck or broken process can completely throw off a workflow or product deadline</u>. Lean agile helps development teams manage time effectively to ensure everyone is utilized, no one's time is wasted, and roadblocks are anticipated in advance.

- **Reduce costs**

When businesses eliminate waste, they save money. In its original form, lean manufacturing ensured companies had the right amount of materials, employees, and working hours at any given time. <u>Overproduction, overhiring, or simply having too many materials to store are expensive wastes that can be eliminated through better management of systems and processes</u>.

Any business, no matter the industry, will save money with improved efficiency. Lean agile ensures that waste is continually eliminated and agile teams continue to fine-tune processes for optimal efficiency.

- **Improve work quality**

With lean agile, it’s not only about efficiency - it's about maintaining efficient processes while bringing a quality product to customers and stakeholders. When businesses intentionally improve processes, they remain competitive. Lean principles consider the customer value of any action or decision to ensure needs are always met or exceeded.

#### Five Principles of Lean Agile

There are <u>five core principles</u> for implementing lean methodology:

1. <u>Value</u>
2. <u>Value stream</u>
3. <u>Flow</u>
4. <u>Pull</u>
5. <u>Perfection</u>

These principles describe a five-step process that guides the implementation of lean techniques for manufacturing, software development teams, and other agile practicing industries.

**Identify value**

The first step requires you to step into the shoes of the customer. <u>Value is what the customer needs and wants from a specific project or product.</u>

Sometimes, customers may be unable to define exactly what they’re looking for — especially if it’s a new product or technology they’re unfamiliar with.

In any case, the project cannot move forward without clearly identifying what it will take to provide customer satisfaction. You’ll need to identify the end goal (value) customers are hoping to find with the product or service.

**Map the value stream**

Next, <u>the team visually maps each of the steps and processes</u> it will take to bring the product from inception to delivery. By making each step visible and always keeping the value top-of-mind, <u>it’s easier to see which steps don’t directly contribute to continuous delivery</u>. Once wasteful steps are found, the team finds ways to eliminate those steps or reduce them as much as possible.

Getting rid of waste ensures your company doesn’t unnecessarily spend money on steps and processes that don’t add value. And — most importantly — the customer gets exactly what they’re looking for.

**Create flow**

Once the waste is eliminated from the value stream, the next step is <u>ensuring the remaining processes work as effectively and efficiently as possible</u>, which means no delays, disruptions, or bottlenecks. It’s important for the steps that create value to work in tight sequences to ensure the product flows smoothly toward the customer.

In order to achieve this kind of agile transformation, <u>lean businesses must train their employees to be adaptive and multi-skilled, create cross-functional teams, break down and reconfigure steps in the production, and balance employee workloads.</u>

**Establish a pull system**

With enhanced flow, your team can deliver products and services faster. <u>A pull system enables “just-in-time” manufacturing and delivery, limiting inventory and work in progress</u> (WIP) items by only producing enough to meet customer demand.

By establishing a pull system, <u>you create products and services as needed as opposed to creating them in advance, which leads to a growing inventory</u> or list of tasks that need to be stored and managed — draining your bottom line.

**Seek perfection**

<u>There is always a process that could be improved</u>, and  there will always be steps in project and product development that waste time and money or don’t deliver value. That’s why the fifth step of  seeking perfection is key.

Lean takes time to implement, and going through the process once is not  enough. Build a continuous improvement mindset into your company  culture, and never settle for the same old.

## Other Development Methodologies

Software development teams are known for using a wide variety of agile methodologies, approaches, and tools to bring value to customers. Depending on the needs of the team and the product's stakeholders, it’s common for teams to deploy and utilize a combination of software development methodologies.

Most dev teams combine methodologies and frameworks to build their own unique approach to product development. You’ll find there are plenty of overlapping principles from one methodology to the next. The key is choosing a system and working as a team to fine-tune and improve that approach so you can continue to reduce waste, maximize efficiency, and master collaboration.

In this post, we’ll outline and compare the following eight software development processes:

1. Agile software development methodology

2. Waterfall methodology

3. Feature driven development (FDD)

4. Lean software development methodology

5. Scrum software development methodology

6. Extreme programming (XP)

7. Rapid application development (RAD)

8. DevOps deployment methodology

## Agile software development methodology

Agile is the most common term used to describe development methods. It’s often used as an umbrella term to label any methodology that’s agile in nature, meaning an iterative process that reduces waste and maximizes efficiency.

Most software development methodologies are agile with a strong emphasis on iteration, collaboration, and efficiency, as opposed to traditional project management. It’s like comparing jazz to classical music.

Traditional, linear management methods, such as the waterfall method we’ll cover below, are like classical music, led by one conductor who has a set plan for how the music should be played. The agile process, on the other hand, is more like jazz, which comes together through collaboration, experimentation, and iteration between band members. It’s adaptive and evolves with new ideas, situations, and directions.

## The waterfall methodology

The waterfall approach is a traditional methodology that’s not very common in software development anymore. For many years, the waterfall model was the leading methodology, but its rigid approach couldn’t meet the dynamic needs of software development.

It’s more common to see the waterfall method used for project management rather than product development. At the beginning of a project, project managers gather all of the necessary information and use it to make an informed plan of action up front. Usually, this plan is a linear, step-by-step process with one task feeding into the next, giving it the “waterfall” name.

The approach is plan-driven and rigid, leaving little room for adjustments. It’s more or less the opposite of agile, prioritizing sticking to the plan rather than adapting to new circumstances.

## Feature driven development (FDD)

Feature driven development is also considered an older methodology. Although it uses some agile principles, it’s viewed as the predecessor of today’s agile and lean methodologies.

As the name says, this process focuses on frequently implementing client-valued features. It’s an iterative process with all eyes on delivering tangible results to end users. The process is adaptive, improving based on new data and results that are collected regularly to help software developers identify and react to errors.

This kind of focused agile methodology can work for some teams that want a highly structured approach and clear deliverables while still leaving some freedom for iteration.

## Lean software development methodology

Lean software development comes from the principles of lean manufacturing. At its core, lean development strives to improve efficiency by eliminating waste. By reducing tasks and activities that don’t add real value, team members can work at optimal efficiency.

The five lean principles provide a workflow that teams use to identify waste and refine processes. Lean is also a guiding mindset that can help people work more efficiently, productively, and effectively.

The philosophies and principles of lean can be applied to agile and other software development methodologies. Lean development provides a clear application for scaling agile practices across large or growing organizations.

## Scrum software development methodology

Scrum is a system regularly used by software development teams. Like many software development methodologies, Scrum is agile, focusing on a value-driven approach. The Scrum process is based on empiricism, which is the theory that knowledge comes from hands-on experience and observable facts.

One Scrum takes place over a preset amount of time called a sprint. Usually, the time frame is between two to four weeks and the Scrum is at the beginning of the sprint. The goal of each sprint is to yield an imperfect but progressing version of a product to bring to stakeholders so that feedback can be integrated right away into the next sprint.

The specific goals of each sprint are determined by a product owner who orders and prioritizes backlog items (the artifacts that need completion). The sprint process repeats over and over again with the development team adjusting and iterating based on successes, failures, and stakeholder feedback.

## Extreme programming (XP)

Extreme programming, also called XP, is a methodology based on improving software quality and responsiveness. It’s an agile approach that evolves based on customer requirements; the ultimate goal is producing high-quality results. Quality isn’t just limited to the final product — it applies to every aspect of the work, ensuring a great work experience for developers, programmers, and managers.

Decision-making in extreme programming is based on five values: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect. The specifics of XP can’t apply to all situations, but the general framework can provide value no matter the context.

## Rapid application development (RAD)

Rapid application development (RAD), sometimes called rapid application building (RAB), is an agile methodology that aims to produce quality results at a low-cost investment. The process prioritizes rapid prototyping and frequent iteration.

Rapid application development begins with defining the project requirements. From there, teams design and build imperfect prototypes to bring to stakeholders as soon as possible. Prototyping and building repeat over and over through iterations until a product is complete and meets customer requirements.

This is ideal for smaller projects with a well-defined objective. The process helps developers make quick adjustments based on frequent feedback from stakeholders. It’s all about creating quick prototypes that can get in front of users for constructive feedback as soon as possible. This feedback is pulled into the user design so that development decisions are based on the direct thoughts and concerns of those who will use the product.

## DevOps deployment methodology

The DevOps deployment methodology is a combination of Dev (software development) and Ops (information technology operations). Together, they create a set of practices designed to improve communication and collaboration between the departments responsible for developing a product.

It's an ongoing loop of communication between product developers and Ops teams (IT operations.) Like so many agile processes, it relies on continuous feedback to help teams save time, increase customer satisfaction, improve launch speed, and reduce risks.

The steps of DevOps deployment repeat, aiming to increase customer satisfaction with new features, functionality, and improvements. However, this methodology has some drawbacks. Some customers don’t want continuous updates to their systems once they are satisfied with an end product.

## Software development made easy

Most software development teams use a combination of methodologies and frameworks to fit their team size, team dynamics, and the type of work being completed. The key is to use an agile methodology and work together to continually improve your systems as you learn and grow.
