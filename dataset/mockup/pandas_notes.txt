Notes on Pandas Behavior

NaN vs Empty String: When pandas reads a CSV with empty cells:

For numeric columns: empty cells become NaN
For string columns: empty cells become empty strings '' or NaN depending on how it's read
With pd.read_csv() default behavior, empty cells typically become NaN


Type Detection: Pandas will attempt to infer types, so:

Columns with mixed types will be read as object dtype
Numeric columns with text will be read as object dtype
You'll need to use pd.to_numeric(), pd.to_datetime() with errors='coerce' to identify type mismatches


Date/Time Ranges Considered Out of Range:

Dates before 1900 or after 2050
Times with invalid values (hours > 23, minutes > 59, seconds > 59)


Missing UIDs in Dataset 2: UIDs 2, 4, 6, 13, 16, 17 from Dataset 1 are not present in Dataset 2 (partial join scenario)
