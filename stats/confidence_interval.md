There are several common mistakes people make when interpreting confidence intervals (CIs). Let me explain the key misconceptions:

Most Critical Misinterpretation:


WRONG: "There is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this interval"
CORRECT: "If we repeated this sampling process many times, about 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true parameter"

The key difference is that a single confidence interval either contains the true parameter or it doesn't - there's no probability involved once the interval is constructed. The 95% refers to the process, not the individual interval.

Other Common Mistakes:


Thinking wider intervals mean more confidence

A wider interval just means more uncertainty in the estimate
The confidence level (e.g., 95%) is about the method, not the width


Assuming symmetry

CIs aren't always symmetrical around the point estimate
This is especially true for ratios, proportions, or non-normal distributions


Misinterpreting overlapping CIs

People often think overlapping CIs mean no significant difference
Actually, CIs can overlap by up to 25% and still indicate a significant difference at p < 0.05




Practical Example:
If you measure temperature with a thermometer showing ±0.5°C accuracy:


WRONG: "There's a 95% chance the true temperature is within 0.5°C of my reading"
CORRECT: "If I took many measurements, about 95% of the intervals I calculate would contain the true temperature"


Statistical vs. Personal Confidence:


Statistical confidence (e.g., 95% CI) is about the procedure's long-run performance
Personal confidence is your subjective belief about a particular result
These are often confused but are fundamentally different concepts
